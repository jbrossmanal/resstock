# What is ResStock
The U.S. residential building sector stock energy model, ResStock<sup>TM<\sup>
, is a highly granular, bottom-up model that uses multiple data sources, statisical
sampling methods, and advanced building energy simulations to estimate
the annual energy consumption of the residential building stock across
the contiguous United States.
ResStock asks and answers two types of questions: 1) How is energy used in
the coniguous U.S. residential housing stock? and 2) What are the impacts
of modifying the housing stock with different technologies?
ResStock, along with our partner model [ComStock](https://nrel.github.io/ComStock.github.io/), is one of the two models
that make up BuildStock, full modeling of the U.S. building stock.

#What does ResStock do
ResStock is a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)
built, national residential building energy stock model. It enables a new approach
to large-scale residential energy analysis scross the U.S. by combining large
public and private data sources, statistical sampling, detailed sub-hourly
building simulations, and high-performance computing.
ResStock helps states, municipalities, utilities, and manufacturers understand
the make-up of their area's housing stock; identify the energy, emissions, 
or economic impacts of energy efficiency or electrification measures; and
explore the impact of new technologies such as cold-climate heat pumps for
both customers and the grid.
ResStock can be tailored to answer the questions that many people have. The
results are available in multiple different formats and resolutions:

| Format | Resolution |
| --- | --- }
| Spatial | U.S., census region, climate zone, state, county, balancing authority, |
|   | ISO/RTO, and Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) |
| Temporal | 15 minutes to annual aggregations |
| Sectoral | All U.S. housing by Census and RECS classifications |

#What Questions Can and Cannot be Answered with ResStock
These are teh types of questions that can be answered via data processing,
distillation, and visualization of this dataset.
**Questions that can be answered:**
    1. Housing makeup and current snapshot of energy consumption
        a. How many homes are heated by electricity or gas? How leaky or
        well insulated are these homes?
        b. how are low-income and renter-occupied housing different from other
        housing units?
        c. What are the largest opportunities for energy efficiency and electrification?
    2. Technology potentials and what-if scenarios
        a. What is the range of savings per household if X,Y, or Z are implemented?
        What are the total expected savings for a program or community with X, Y, or Z?
        b. What are the energy, carbon, or utility bill impacts of a home envelope
        upgrade versus a heat pump upgrade?
    3. Addressable questions with timeseries and customization
        a. Does residential electrification shift a region from summer-peaking
        to winter-peaking?
        b. What is the total change in peak demand from energy efficiency?
        c. How do higher efficiency equipment or envelope improvements affect
        the change in peak demand?
**The following questions are housing adjacent, but cannot be answered by ResStock data alone:**
    1. What is the potential for rooftop or community solar?
    2. How many homes qualify for Weatherization Assistance Program or other
    specific policies?
    3. How might different income groups leverage financing mechanisms?
    4. What is the cost of installing a heat pump?
    5. What is the electrification potential for a specific home address?

#How to use ResStock
ResStock provides access to results through many different forms, including
a web data viewer, dashboards, and raw data available for download.
ResStock leverages and is deeply indebted to DOE's open-source building energy
modeling ecosystem of [OpenStudio](https://openstudio.net/) and [Energy Plus](https://energyplus.net/).
